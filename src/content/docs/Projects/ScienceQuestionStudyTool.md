title: Science Question Study Tool 
description: A independently built machine-learning model that creates and classifies science questions to be used as a study tool.
---

<p> This project aims to develop a website that generates word problems for science subjects, namely Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, as a study tool for user. The word problems will be generated using supervised machine learning techniques implemented in Python, using libraries like scikit-learn. The goal is to train a model to understand and extract information from a dataset of word problems to be able to generate problems independently.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
