# Launch Post
This is the start of my blog, documentating my journey through the world of programming. I will be posting about my projects, my thoughts and my learnings. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.

## Why am I doing this?
I wanted to get experience working with the Astro framework, practing hosting a website and writing blog posts. I also wanted to document my journey through programming, so I can look back and see how far I've come. I learned from Mr.Holmes from my Computer Science class in high school about the importance of good documentation, and I hope to apply that here.

## What will I be posting about?
I will post about my projects, my ideas and my learning. Hopefully this blog doesn't just become a vent page of me complaining about my code not working. I will try to post at least once a month.

## Github
I will be posting all my code on Github, so you can check it out there. I will also be posting my projects on my website, so you can see them in action. The link is https://github.com/Keobkeig.
