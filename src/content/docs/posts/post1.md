# What Has Happened Since Post 0?
In chronological order, a lot has happened in the past week. Besides working on this blog website, I have also started working on a [linear algebra library in JavaScript](https://github.com/Keobkeig/MatrixLinAlgLib) with plans on releasing it to npm soon so it can be used by anyone. As of this moment, I have finished all the matrix methods but I will have to also start the vectors class and methods. However, that will have to wait for Post#2 as I have begun my internship at XCave LLC this week as a data engineering intern. 

## What is XCave LLC? + About My Internship
[XCave LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/executive-placement-network/about/) (Executive Placement Network on Google, LinkedIn, etc) is a hiring executive search firm based in New York City. What that essentially means is that they look through resumes and find the best candidates for a job. It's quite a small company, located in the Finicial District, but that also means that my work will be meaningful for the company and there will be more efforts spent on my training. 

My internship role is a data engineering intern, working with the Web Scraping and Data Engineering team. Since it is my first week, I am still learning about the company and what they do, as well as the tools they use. So far I have learned about web scraping and how to use Python to scrape data from websites to then be organized into functional data. Although I already have experience working in data analytics back from my Google Mentorship project, I have never worked with web scraping before so it is a new experience for me.
I hope to learn lots from this opportunity and I am excited to see what I can do for the company.

## What Am I Working On?
I am currently working on a personal project, a linear algebra library in JavaScript. I have finished all the matrix methods but I will have to also start the vectors class and methods. I will be posting updates on my progress on this blog, so stay tuned for that. 

## Why Am I Making A Linear Algebra Library?
I had multiple reasons for wanting to start this project. First off, I was always very interesting in developing a tool that would do linear algebra, as its my favorite math subject at the moment. However, when looking at linear algebra libraries, I find certain aspects missing, so I wanted to write them myself.

The decision for writing this library in JavaScript as opposed to Java or Python was to treat this sort of a learning "quiz" for JavaScript. Having only started learning it in the summer, I had tried to develop a [Discord bot](https://github.com/Keobkeig/RT-Translator-Discord-Bot) that would translate messages in real time, but the project had to be put on hiatus. It was because that despite being functional, the code was very messy and I was running into troubles with translation API I was using (both LibreTranslate and Google Translate API). I think the reason the project was such a disaster was due to the lack of experience with APIs and JavaScript syntax overall, so hopefully this library project will help build up that experience. 

I hope to release this library to npm soon, so stay tuned for that.

## Farewell
That's all for this post. I hope you enjoyed reading it and I hope to see you in the next one. (Working on writing blog posts is teaching me how to write better markdown files, so I hope the future post will be nicer looking.)
